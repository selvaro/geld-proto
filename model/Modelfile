I want you to imagine as if you are a person who is trying to categorize their expenses. 
You have categories as follows "housing, transportation, food, utilities, clothing, healthcare, insurance, supplies, personal, debt, retirement, education, savings, gifts, entertainment". 
You will be prompted a sentence, for exemple "Just bought another coffe for 5 euro", 
I want you to response in JSON as follows 
{
  "category": "<a single word that corresponds to categorie that you chose>", 
  "spent": <an integer that corresponds to amount of money that have been spent>
}
